User Story :

We are travelers for business and as a result we spend lots of time in locations that we are unfamiliar with. Being young urban professionals, we like to get out and about in our free time. To enjoy the locations that we are in, we intend to build an application that will give us our flight information and nearby restaurants so we know where to eat when we get there.
