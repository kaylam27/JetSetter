User Story :


We are travelers for business and as a result we spend lots of time in locations that we are unfamiliar with. Being young urban professionals, we like to get out and about in our free time. To enjoy the locations that we are in, we intend to build an application that will give us our flight information and nearby restaurants so we know where to eat when we get there.


We are a group of young urban professionals that constantly find ourselves navigating through different websites when it comes to traveling whether it’s for work or personal touring. We have developed this site that makes everything readily accessible in one single site, making every search less time consuming and more enjoyable.
