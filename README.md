User Story :

We are travelers for business and as a result we spend lots of time in locations that we are unfamiliar with and being young urban professionals we like to get out and about in our free time. To enjoy the locations that we are in. We intend to build an application that will give us location information, flight information, utilities and weather so we can get out and about with little to no effort.
